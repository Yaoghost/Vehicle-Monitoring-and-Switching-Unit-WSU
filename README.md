# Vehicle-Monitoring-and-Switching-Unit-WSU
This repository contains the **STM32 firmware** for the *Monitoring and Switching Unit for Pre-OBD II Vehicles*.  
The STM32 microcontroller acts as the bridge between the vehicle‚Äôs analog sensors and the user interface (Nextion 2.4‚Ä≥ display).

## üìå Project Overview
Older vehicles lack modern instrumentation and rely on outdated gauges or ‚Äúdummy lights.‚Äù  
This project provides a compact module that:
- Reads signals from fuel, oil pressure, and coolant temperature sensors.
- Processes analog data through ADCs on the STM32.
- Communicates results to a Nextion display for a clean, modern UI.
- Supports future features like MPG calculation, trip logging, and accessory switching.

This repo specifically covers the **STM32 codebase**.
